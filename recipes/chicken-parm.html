    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan is a dish that consists of breaded chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and three different cheeses: mozzarella, parmesan, or provolone.</p>
    <p>Chicken Parmesan originated in the Italian diaspora in the United States during the early 20th century.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
        <li>Provolone cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
        <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.</li>
        <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven. </li>
        <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
    </ol>
