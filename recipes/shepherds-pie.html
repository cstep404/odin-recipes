    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or in its French version hachis Parmentier is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked. The meat used may be either previously cooked or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb.</p>
    <p>The two English terms have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and the 19th century, although some writers insist that a shepherd's pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow onion</li>
        <li>Ground lamb or beef</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Beef broth</li>
        <li>Peas and carrots</li>
        <li>Corn</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil to a large skillet and place it over medium-high heat for 2 minutes. Add the onions. Cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef (or ground lamb) to the skillet and break it apart with a wooden spoon. Add the parsley, rosemary, thyme, salt, and and pepper. Stir well. Cook for 6-8 minutes, until the meat is browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce and garlic. Stir to combine. Cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and tomato paste. Stir until well incorporated and no clumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
        <li>Add the broth, frozen peas and carrots, and frozen corn. Bring the liquid to a boil then reduce to simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Set the meat mixture aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot. Cover the potatoes with water. Bring the water to a boil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook until potatoes are fork tender, 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander. Return the potatoes to the hot pot. Let the potatoes rest in the hot pot for 1 minute to evaporate any remaining liquid.</li>
        <li>Add butter, half & half, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mash the potatoes and stir until all the ingredients are mixed together.</li>
        <li>Add the parmesan cheese to the potatoes. Stir until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the meat mixture into a 9x9 (or 7x11) inch baking dish. Spread it out into an even layer. Spoon the mashed potatoes on top of the meat. Carefully spread into an even layer.</li>
        <li>If the baking dish looks very full, place it on a rimmed baking sheet so that the filling doesnâ€™t bubble over into your oven. Bake uncovered for 25-30 minutes.** Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
